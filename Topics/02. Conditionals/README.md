## Exercises

* Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay. Your program give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours

    > #### Example
    > * Enter Hours: **45**
    > * Enter Rate: **10**
    >
    > Pay: **475.0**  (*Tips*: 475 = 40 * 10 + 5 * 15)

* Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully.

    > #### Example
    > * Enter Hours: **20**
    > * Enter Rate: **nine**
    >> Error, please enter numeric input
    >
    > * Enter Hours: **forty**
    >> Error, please enter numeric input

* Assume the days of the week are numbered 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 from Sunday to Saturday. Write a function which is given the day number, and it returns the day name (a string).

* Give the logical opposites of these conditions
    > 1. a > b
    > 2. a >= b
    > 3. a >= 18 and day == 3
    > 4. a >= 18 and day != 3
