## Exercises

* Write a program that reads a file and prints only those lines that contain the substring pass as arguments
* Write a program that reads a text file and produces an output file which is a copy of the file, except the first five columns of each line contain a four digit line number, followed by a space, and followed with the full line.
* Write a program that undoes the numbering of the previous excercise: it should read a file with numbered lines and produce another file without line numbers.
