## Exercises

* Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay. Your program give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours. Create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and rate)

    > #### Example
    > * Enter Hours: **45**
    > * Enter Rate: **10**
    >
    > Pay: **475.0**  (*Tips*: 475 = 40 * 10 + 5 * 15)

* Write a function area_of_circle(r) which returns the area of a circle of radius r.
* Write a fruitful function sum_to(n) that returns the sum of all integer numbers up to and including n. So sum_to(10) would be 1+2+3...+10 which would return the value 55.
